# Why this space?
I like to write and I also like to forget things. So I take notes and make schemes about the things I learn during my daily activities, to read them from time to time and refresh my mind.
I decided to (or at least try to) translate them into a blog, to hopefully make them useful for the "me" of the future and for other people too.
Also, English is not my first language, so this is a good opportunity to keep myself trained and improve it.

Any suggestions are welcome!
