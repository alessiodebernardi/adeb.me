## Instructions to build it locally

To launch a local live instance of Hugo:
```
make server
```

To build the static site (no live reload):
```
make build
```

### Theme installation
The first time that the repository is cloned, you need to download the theme, installed as a git submodule:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
